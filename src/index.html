      This project was created for the freeCodeCamp curriculum. It makes an ajax request using the axios
      library and bind the data to a generated svg graph utilizing
      The <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> data visualization library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The json data contains nodes (countries), and links (connections). A force-graph was created 
      with each link displaying geographic adjacency. Moving the cursor over each flag will display
      the name of the country. Dragging the flag will pull that node's connections along with it.
